I was trying to write a front end for blog site app using react. This was more of a personal hobby.

The app needs to install packages first using a node package manager. In this case, I'm using npm. Go to `...\blog-progect` directory using terminal and then install packages using

`> npm install`

After installing packages, you can run the app

`> npm start`

You can also use any other package manager i.e. yarn, npx etc.
